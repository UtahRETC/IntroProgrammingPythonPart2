# Overview

Discuss imports, annotations, and keyword arguments in order to be able to
write basic Flask applications. Then move on to HTTP basics, like routing and
methods, clients vs. servers, URLs, ports, paths, Domains vs. IPs vs.
localhost/127.0.0.1. Discuss how ports let you run multiple servers, show what
happens when the same port is re-used, discuss the need for restarting the
server in order to get new code.

This unit should also include a review of HTML and CSS. We can re-use the Khan
Academy assignment from last class.
