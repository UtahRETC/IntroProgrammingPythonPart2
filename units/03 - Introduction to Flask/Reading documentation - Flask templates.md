title: "Reading documentation: Flask templates"
---

## Instructions

For this assignment, you will be reading part Flask's official documentation.
Learning how to use technical documentation is an important skill, so we will
practice by taking small sections of documentation to read on your own, and
then later review together as a class.

Head over to [Flask's
Quickstart](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/quickstart)
documentation and read the \quoted{Rendering Templates} section. Click on [this
link](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/quickstart/#rendering-templates)
for a direct link to that section.

Note that the purpose of this assignment is to start getting familiar with
technical documentation, and not to walk away fully understanding how templates
in Flask work, that is secondary. Take any extra time you have to try the code
examples in the page, review the other sections, and/or follow any of the links
to the other libraries mentioned in the documentation.
