<h1>Dwayne Johnson</h1>
<h2>Bio</h2>
Hi, I'm Dwayne Johnson and welcome to my home page! Lots of people call me "The Rock"! I like wrestling and acting in movies.
<br/>
I was born in Hayward, California and lived in many places while growing up, include New Zealand, Connecticut, and Hawaii. I graduated from Freedom High School in Pennsylvania in 1990, where I played football. I went to college at the University of Miami, where I also played football while working on my Criminology and Physiology majors.<p/>
In 1996 started wrestling in the WWF. I eventually became champion in 2000-2002! It was a lot of fun.
<p/>
These days I mostly act in movies and hang out with my family. I also like working out and playing frisbee.
