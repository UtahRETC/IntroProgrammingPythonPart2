# Overview

Learn about reading and writing to files in our computer. We'll also cover the
basics of serialization and deserialization. What is the "state" of a program
and how can we store it in a file that we later reload into memory. After
learning about reading and writing state to files, we can discuss databases and
their application in larger programs.
