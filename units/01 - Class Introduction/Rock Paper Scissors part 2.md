title: Rock Paper Scissors, part 2
---

## Introduction

In this assignment we will update the Rock Paper Scissors program from the
previous assingment and add a game loop that allows the player to play multiple
times without restarting the program. In order to complete this assignment, you
will need to use user input, comparison operators, loops, and possibly
conditionals.
