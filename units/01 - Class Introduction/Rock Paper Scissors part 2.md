title: Rock Paper Scissors, part 2
---

## Overview

In this assignment we will update our Rock Paper Scissors program from part 1
and and a game loop that allows the player to play multiple times. In order to
complete this assignment, you will need to use user input, comparison
operators, loops, and possibly conditionals.

## Instructions

Take the code from part 1, and update your program to ask the user if they
would like to play again once they have played. Your program should print
\quoted{Would you like to play again?}, and when the user enters `yes`, you
should let them play around round. If they enter anything else, you should stop
the program.

In order to get full credit for this assignment, you need to use a loop and a
`break` statement.
