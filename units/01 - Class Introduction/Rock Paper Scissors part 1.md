## Overview

In this assignment we will implement the game of Rock Paper Scissors. In order
to complete this assignment, you will need to accept user input, use comparison
operators, and conditionals as well.

## Instructions

Create a program that lets you play Rock Paper Scissors against your computer.
Your program should first randomly choose between rock, paper, or scissors.
This will be the computer's choice. It then should ask the user for their
choice with a message of \quoted{Please enter your move:}.

Using the two choices, determine the winner based on the rules of Rock Paper
Scissors where rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
If the player wins, print \quoted{The computer chose <computers choice>, you
win!} Otherwise, print \quoted{The computer chose <computers choice>, better
luck next time.} \lookhere{Your text output should match this.}
