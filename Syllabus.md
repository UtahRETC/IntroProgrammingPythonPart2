## Overview

This is a continuation of the Introduction to Programming with Python class, and we'll continue where we left off in that class and finish learning about basic concepts in modern programming and dive deeper into Web Programming.

## Objectives

The objective of this class is to reinforce your knowledge of programming by teaching you the basic of Web Programming. By the end of this class students should be able to write their own basic web applications using Python (Flask), HTML, and CSS.

## Homework

Homework assignments will be assigned every week. Assignments should be submitted via Canvas. The assignment's due date and requirements will be detailed in Canvas as well.

## Grade requirements

A minimum of 70% is required to pass this class. There are no tests or quizzes, grades are 100% based on homework assignments.

## Outline

### Unit 1: Class Introduction

Beginning of the Python 2 class. We'll continue where we left off in Python 1,
starting with a review of the main topics from Python 1: lists, loops,
conditionals, and functions.

### Unit 2: Dictionaries

Compare dictionaries to lists as a data structure for storing data. Compare
uses and benefits of a dictionary vs. a list. When would someone reach for a
dictionary as opposed to a list?

### Unit 3: Introduction to Flask

Discuss imports, annotations. HTTP basics, like routing and methods, clients
vs. servers. This unit should also include a review of HTML and CSS.

### Unit 4: Classes

In this unit we will learn about classes in Python. We’ll cover their basic
functionality, the concept of encapsulation and when and why it’s useful, and
also talk about how we’ve already been using classes (Flash,
int/string/float/etc.)

### Unit 5: File IO

Learn about reading and writing to files in our computer. We'll also cover the
basics of serialization and deserialization. What is the "state" of a program
and how can we store it in a file that we later reload into memory. After
learning about reading and writing state to files, we can discuss databases and
their application in larger programs.

### Unit 6: Error handling

Basics of error handling and why it's needed in program. Learn about errors
resulting from user inputs vs. application errors. Learn about detecting and
recovering from errors.

### Unit 7: Modules

As projects grow in size and complexity, they are broken up into multiple
files. In Python, each file of a program is module. We'll learn about how to
create and work with our own modules.
