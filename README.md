- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)


## Outline

### Unit 1: Class Introduction

Beginning of the Python 2 class. We'll continue where we left off in Python 1,
starting with a review of the main topics from Python 1: lists, loops,
conditionals, and functions.

### Unit 2: Web Programming

In this unit we will start learning about web technologies that are used to
build webpages and web applications.

### Unit 3: Introduction to Flask

Discuss imports, annotations. HTTP basics, like routing and methods, clients
vs. servers. This unit should also include a review of HTML and CSS.

### Unit 4: File IO

Learn about reading and writing to files in our computer. We'll also cover the
basics of serialization and deserialization. What is the "state" of a program
and how can we store it in a file that we later reload into memory. After
learning about reading and writing state to files, we can discuss databases and
their application in larger programs.

### Unit 5: Error handling

Basics of error handling and why it's needed in program. Learn about errors
resulting from user inputs vs. application errors. Learn about detecting and
recovering from errors.

### Unit 6: Classes

In this unit we will learn about classes in Python. We’ll cover their basic
functionality, the concept of encapsulation and when and why it’s useful, and
also talk about how we’ve already been using classes (Flash,
int/string/float/etc.)

### Unit 7: Modules

As projects grow in size and complexity, they are broken up into multiple
files. In Python, each file of a program is module. We'll learn about how to
create and work with our own modules.
