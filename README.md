# Introduction to Programming with Python, part 2

## Requirements

- [Marp](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli#install)
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)


## Outline

### Unit 6: Class Introduction

Beginning of the Python 2 class. We'll continue where we left off in Python 1,
starting with a review of the main topics from Python 1: lists, loops,
conditionals, and functions.

### Unit 7: Dictionaries

Compare dictionaries to lists as a data structure for storing data. Compare
uses and benefits of a dictionary vs. a list. When would someone reach for a
dictionary as opposed to a list?

### Unit 8: Introduction to Flask

Discuss imports, annotations. HTTP basics, like routing and methods, clients
vs. servers. This unit should also include a review of HTML and CSS.

### Unit 9: Classes

In this unit we will learn about classes in Python. We’ll cover their basic
functionality, the concept of encapsulation and when and why it’s useful, and
also talk about how we’ve already been using classes (Flash,
int/string/float/etc.)

### Unit 10: File IO

Learn about reading and writing to files in our computer. We'll also cover the
basics of serialization and deserialization. What is the "state" of a program
and how can we store it in a file that we later reload into memory. After
learning about reading and writing state to files, we can discuss databases and
their application in larger programs.

### Unit 11: Error handling

Basics of error handling and why it's needed in program. Learn about errors
resulting from user inputs vs. application errors. Learn about detecting and
recovering from errors.
